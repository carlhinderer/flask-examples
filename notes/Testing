- Testing Without Installing Project as Package

    code
      + src
        + foo
          > bar.py
      + tests
        + foo
          > test_bar.py


    # test_bar.py
    ----------------
    import src.foo.bar


    # Run tests
    $ cd code
    $ python -m pytest tests        # This adds our current directory to the path



- Testing By Installing as Package (Recommended by pytest)

    - For development, use venv for virtual environments and pip for installing your application and
        any dependencies, as well as the pytest package itself.


    - Next, put 'pyproject.toml' and 'setup.cfg' files at the root of your package.

        # pyproject.toml
        ----------------------
        [build-system]
        requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
        build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"


        # setup.cfg
        ----------------------
        [metadata]
        name = PACKAGENAME

        [options]
        packages = find:


    - If your pip version is older than 21.3, you also need a 'setup.py' file.

        # setup.py
        ----------------------
        from setuptools import setup

        setup()


    - Now, we can install our package in editable mode, which lets us change our code and tests at will.

        $ cd package-root
        $ pip install -e .
